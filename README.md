# SageMaker Deployment Project

In this project, I trained an RNN (Recurrent neural network) for sentiment analysis, deployed it using Amazon Sagemaker, and produced  a simple web app which interacts with a deployed neural network. The app analyses movie reviews and predicts whether a review is negative or positive.
